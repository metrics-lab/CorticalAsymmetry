### Setting up permutation analyses
- Explanation of PALM flag
- Description of surface averaging
- Masks
- Correction across modalities and contrasts
- ise flag
- permutation number defaults to 10,000
- Contrast and design matrices generated using FSL GLM setup. Great explanations for different scenarios. 

### Experiment
1. dHCP term-born neonates
2. dHCP term- vs. preterm-born neonates at term-equivalent age
3. HCP-YA
4. HCP-YA vs. dHCP term-born neonates
